# Google Workspace MCP Server - Development Guide

This project is a complete Google Workspace MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) server that provides secure access to Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Tasks through a standardized API interface.

## **Project Overview**

The Google Workspace MCP server is fully implemented and production-ready, supporting:

- **Google Drive**: File search, content retrieval, and advanced content-based searches
- **Gmail**: Email search, message details, and label management  
- **Google Calendar**: Calendar and event management with smart defaults
- **Google Tasks**: Complete task management including CRUD operations and search

## **Architecture Documentation**

The complete project architecture, setup instructions, and API specifications are documented in the **[Google Workspace MCP Service Implementation Plan](google-workspace-mcp.md)**. This comprehensive document covers:

- **Project Setup**: Google Cloud configuration, API enablement, and OAuth 2.0 setup
- **Tool Definitions**: Complete specifications for all Google Workspace tools
- **Server Implementation**: MCP server architecture and design patterns
- **Containerization**: Docker deployment and configuration
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 flow and security considerations

## **Development Guidelines**

All code in this project follows the standards defined in the **[Python and FastAPI Development Guidelines](python.mdc)**. These guidelines ensure:

- **Code Consistency**: Functional programming patterns and naming conventions
- **FastAPI Best Practices**: Async operations, dependency injection, and error handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching strategies and efficient data handling
- **Robust Error Handling**: Consistent error management across all tools

## **Current Implementation Status**

âœ… **Production Ready** - All planned features are implemented and tested:

- **53 passing tests** with comprehensive coverage
- **7 Google Tasks tools** fully implemented with async patterns
- **Complete OAuth 2.0 integration** with all required scopes
- **Comprehensive documentation** and usage examples
- **Docker deployment** ready for production use

## **Getting Started**

1. Review the **[Service Implementation Plan](google-workspace-mcp.md)** for setup instructions
2. Follow the **[Development Guidelines](python.mdc)** for code contributions
